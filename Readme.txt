Bootstrap 5 Task

 
This is a little project I made , I went through some of the official examples, grabbed a few components I liked, and then mixed them together into my own pages. The idea wasn’t to copy, but to try and build something that looks clean and responsive.

📖 What I Built

Home Page → Navbar + Hero section + Features + Footer

About Page → A simple page to test layouts and sections

Contact Page → With a form (because every site needs one )
